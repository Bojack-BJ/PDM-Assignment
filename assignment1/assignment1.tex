    \section{Graph Search}
    Consider a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, with distances $d(e)$ for each $e \in E$, and consider two nodes $s, t \in V$. For each node $v$ we define the function $P_s(v)$, which gives the length of the shortest path from $s$ to $v$. Similar we define the function $P_t(v)$, which gives the length of the shortest path from $v$ to $t$.
        \subsection{Question1.1}
        Show that for every edge $e = (u, v)$, the length of the shortest path from node $s$ to node $t$ that uses the edge $e$ is $P_s(u) + d(e) + P_t(v)$.\\\\
        Answer: Since $G$ is a directed graph, so if you want to get to node $t$ via edge $e=(u,v)$ from node $s$, you must first get to node $u$ from node $s$, then get to node $t$ from node $v$. Since $d(e)$ is fixed, it is obvious that the shortest path from $s$ to $t$ is $P_s(u) + d(e) + P_t(v)$.

        \subsection{Question1.2}
        Let $Q$ be the shortest path between the nodes $s$ and $t$. Use the property obtained in Question 1.1, to propose an algorithm that finds the second shortest path from $s$ to $t$ (i.e., considering all paths that are not exactly equal to $Q$)\\\\
